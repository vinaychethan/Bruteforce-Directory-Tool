# directory-brutefoce
Basic Directory Brute force Tool made in python
In this Project I have used Argparse python module to develop this tool.And also I have used requests module to connect the http servers which includes api’s. For that we need to use the commands:
•	Pip install argparse
•	Pip install requests
 For executing the brute.py file we need to use the command of :
•	python3 brute.py
•	python3 brute.py -w wordlist.txt -u <url>
